# Difference between Cybersecurity and Information Security

## Introduction
* In the real world, the terms cybersecurity and information security are often used interchangeably.
* Strictly speaking, there are differences between the two concepts.

## Storage Device Example
* Keeping a storage device in a safe or protecting it from theft falls under information security, not cybersecurity.

## Definitions
* Cybersecurity: Protecting data from cyber threats that exist in the cyber world, primarily on the internet.
* Information security: Broader concept that includes protection from various types of threats, including cyber threats and physical threats.

## Cybersecurity vs. Information Security
* Cybersecurity focuses specifically on protecting data from cyber threats.
* Information security is more comprehensive, covering protection against cyber threats and physical threats.

## Special Branches of Cybersecurity
* Cyber law, cyber crime, and cyber warfare are specialized areas within cybersecurity.
* Cyber warfare involves cyber attacks launched by one country against another.

## Recommendation
* In most cases, using the term cybersecurity is sufficient, as the majority of threats are cyber-related.

# The Trinity of IT Security - CIA/DAD
 
## CIA
* Confidentiality 
    * Data is acessed only by those with the permission
    * Encryption
    * Passwords
    * Biometrics
    * 2FA
    * MFA
* Integrity
    * Data has not been tampered or altered in any way
    * Hashing
    * checksums
* Availability
    * Data and resources are available to be acessed or shared
    * Network access
    * Server and data availability

## DAD
* Disclosure
    * Data is acessed by non-authorized users
    * Trojans
    * Brute force attacks
    * Theft
        * Physical theft of computers, CDs, Hard drives
* Alteration
    * Data has been compromised or tampered with
    * Malware
    * Viruses
    * SQL injection
* Deniability
    * Access to data and resources are block
    * Denial of Service attacks
    * Ransomware

# Basic Terminologies

* Blacklist: Used to refer to a list of banned IP addresses, applications, or users.
* Whitelist: The exact opposite of a blacklist.
* Catfishing: The process of creating a fake online profile in order to trick people into believing they are someone else for financial gain.
* Authentication: The process of proving an individual is who they claim to be.
* Data Mining: The activity of analyzing and/or searching through data in order to find items of relevance, significance, or value.
* Threat: This generally refers to anything that has the potential to cause our data, systems, and networks harm.
* Exploit: A clearly defined way to breach the security of a system.
* Vulnerabilities: These are weaknesses within a system or network that can be exploited to cause us harm.
* Risk: This refers to the likelihood of something bad happening. A risk requires both a threat and a vulnerability to exist.
* Zero Day: This is used to describe a threat that is unknown to security specialists and has not been addressed.
* Hack Value: This describes a target that may attract an above-average level of attention from an attacker.
* Non-Repudiation: This is the concept that once an action is carried out by a party, it cannot be denied by that same party.
* Logic Bomb: A malicious code that is only triggered when a set of conditions are met.
* Obfuscation: A term used to describe the tactic of making code unclear so that humans or programs like an antivirus cannot understand it.
* Honey Pot: A decoy or trap for hackers.
* Spoof: The act of falsifying the identity of the source of a communication or interaction.

# Protocols

## Introduction
* Definition of a protocol: a set of rules for computer communication
* Protocols govern various aspects of computer communication

## Role of Protocols
* Communication between computers on the same network
* Exchange of information and accessing websites
* Transmission of internet documents to computer screens
* Ordering and termination of conversations between computers and networks

## Popular Protocols
* HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
  * Major protocol of the internet
  * Facilitates communication between browsers and web servers
  * Stateless system: connection dropped after request is satisfied
* HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure)
  * Secure version of HTTP
  * Provides encryption for data protection
  * S for "secured"

## Examples of HTTP and HTTPS in Action
* HTTP: non-secure connection
* HTTPS: secure connection
* Importance of HTTPS for sensitive information exchange

## SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and SSH (Secure Shell)
* SSL used by HTTPS to provide encryption
* SSH used by programmers and network administrators
* SSL and SSH are not protocols themselves, but used by security protocols

## FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
* FTP: governs file transmission between computers
* SFTP: secure version of FTP, provides encryption

## IMAP (Internet Access Message Protocol) and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
* IMAP: controls internet message sending
* SMTP: governs email sending and receiving

## Conclusion
* Understanding protocols is crucial for cybersecurity professionals

# Cookies

## What are Cookies?
* Definition: Text files placed on your computer when visiting a website
* Purpose: Track visit details and store preferences
* Objective: Increase speed of revisiting the same website
* Usefulness for advertisers: Matching ads to your interests based on browsing history

## Impact on Computer Security
* Privacy concerns: Cookies and temporary files disclose online habits
* Mitigation: Modify web browser preferences to set limits on cookies

# TCP/IP Protocol

## Introduction
* TCP/IP Protocol is important in the world of computer security
* TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol
* IP stands for Internet Protocol

## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
* Divides a message or file into smaller packets for transmission
* Packets are reassembled at the destination
* Analogy: Sending a large device in smaller packages
* Improves effective transmission over the internet

## IP (Internet Protocol)
* Responsible for addressing each packet to ensure correct delivery
* Ensures packets are sent to the right destination

## TCP/IP Protocols
* Suite of protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet
* Divided into four major layers:
  1. Datalink Layer: Protocols operating on a link that connects hosts on a network (e.g., Ethernet protocol)
  2. Internet/Networking Layer: Connects independent networks together (e.g., IP protocol)
  3. Transport Layer: Handles communication between hosts (e.g., TCP protocol)
  4. Application Layer: Standardizes data exchange (e.g., HTTP and FTP protocols)

## Applications of TCP/IP
* Used for various forms of communication on the internet
* Examples include email communication, online gaming, etc.

## Conclusion
* TCP/IP Protocol is widely used and important in computer communications
